alright so basically this is roblox bad apple with some python script i made with little experience lol

the python script converts images to roblox color3 values and then sends them into one module script as i found that trying to load another while one is playing freezes it for like 2 seconds so putting it in one means less data but a smooth roblox video.

also roblox freezes when you put the data into a modulescript. I heard someone sent the data over a localhost server but ngl im not advanced enough to do that lol.

the project.rbxl should work straight out of the box and the scripts to run everything should be in playerstarterscripts and replicatedstorage.

took me forever to figure out how to make this so hopefully someone else can use this to help them figure this out.

png files are small cause any bigger and roblox just crashes.
